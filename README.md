## Layout Design

The layout design was challenging as I had limited experience in designing a website by myself. I browsed and looked to other developers portfolios for inspiration and came across freecodecamp top 15 portfolio sites.

I decided on a layout in my head. I moved onto selecting a theme for my portfolio site. I stumbled across a site - http://mattfarley.ca/

I chose orange, black, blue and white. There were hundreds of websites i stumbled across before I made the decision of my colour scheme. But I wanted something that would stand out.

I went on - https://www.fiverr.com/ to get a logo design. I paid $20 for the overall design process

### Images/Multimedia 

For free images, I used https://www.pexels.com/ for providing free images. I used https://www.pexels.com/photo/coding-computer-data-depth-of-field-577585/ for my background.

I used https://fontawesome.com/ and http://konpa.github.io/devicon/ for my icons
